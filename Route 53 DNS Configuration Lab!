Thrilled to share my latest hands-on cloud project! I just completed a lab where I configured DNS within a VPC using Amazon Route 53, set up an Ubuntu server, installed Apache, and deployed a custom website accessible via DNS. 🎉

Key steps included:
1️⃣ Setting up a VPC with DNS hostname and resolution enabled. 
2️⃣ Launching an Ubuntu server and installing Apache.
3️⃣ Deploying a custom website by transferring files via S3 and configuring Apache. 
4️⃣ Configuring Route 53 with a hosted zone and custom DNS records to verify functionality.

This lab was a fantastic learning experience, connecting foundational cloud concepts with practical application! 🌐

Stay tuned, as I’ll be sharing more cloud projects that dive deeper into AWS tools and architecture. If you’re interested in learning cloud computing, follow along, and let’s connect! 🙌
