# Cloud_Projects
Welcome to my Cloud Projects repository! This collection showcases hands-on projects I've completed in cloud computing, focusing primarily on AWS infrastructure and tools. Here, you'll find detailed examples of cloud setups, configurations, and deploymentsâ€”all documented to aid understanding and practical learning.

**About This Repository**
As I progress in cloud computing, Iâ€™ll be continuously adding projects that demonstrate key concepts, configurations, and use cases within cloud environments. Whether you're interested in AWS networking, storage solutions, load balancing, or DNS management, I hope these projects provide value to anyone looking to dive deeper into cloud technologies.

**Current Projects**
1. Route 53 and VPC DNS Configuration
Overview: This project involves configuring DNS within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Amazon Route 53. The setup includes launching an Ubuntu server, installing an Apache server, and making a custom website accessible via DNS. Key components of this lab include:

Setting up VPC with DNS hostname and resolution enabled
Launching and configuring an Ubuntu server with Apache
Transferring custom website files to the server using an S3 bucket
Configuring a hosted zone and DNS records in Route 53
Check out the project folder for detailed instructions and configurations.

**Upcoming Projects**
Stay tuned for additional cloud projects that will cover a range of AWS services, including:

Load Balancing and Autoscaling
Advanced Networking and Security Configurations
Data Storage and Management
Real-world Multi-Tier Architecture Deployments
**How to Use This Repository**
Each project is organized into its own folder, containing setup instructions, code, and resources. Follow along to replicate the setups, or use these examples as a foundation for your own cloud projects.

If you're also exploring cloud computing, feel free to connect, explore, and reach out with any questions or ideas! ðŸ˜Š

This README not only introduces the repository's purpose but also encourages other cloud learners to engage with your work. Let me know if you'd like to adjust any details!
